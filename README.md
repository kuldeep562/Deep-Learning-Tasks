# ğŸ§  Deep Learning Tasks

This repository brings together all practical deep learning tasks. Each task explores foundational to intermediate concepts in deep learning, using libraries such as NumPy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

---

## ğŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `assignment-1/`: Tasks 1â€“10 implemented using TensorFlow, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
- `assignment-2/`: Extended or re-implemented tasks using additional frameworks like PyTorch and more advanced techniques.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains all required packages for both assignments.
- `data/`: Add datasets and images used across tasks.
